iOS developer [Jeff Campbell called out](https://twitter.com/Darchmare/status/866401456252833792) this open source omission, declaring: "Docs are too often an 
afterthought in the open source world." Perhaps this is because, 
following author Steve McConnell's direction, many developers believe 
that "good code is its own best documentation," and, of course, assume 
their code is very good.

As professor and former Joomla! developer [Elin Waring said](https://twitter.com/ElinWaring/status/872828105563492354) to me: "[Y]ou can read the code and automated docs. When people complain about docs it is not always clear what they mean".... [She went on](https://twitter.com/ElinWaring/status/872829226940018689):
 "Different people need different docs, [which is] why 'everyone 
complains about docs' is so hard to respond to. It's a constantly moving
 target."
